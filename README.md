# Haagerup_wave_function_overlap

Code for our paper: xxxx.xxxxx

## ED (exact diagonalization)
Created and maintained by Yuhan Liu. The code is written in python.
* `Haagerup_main.py` is the main function, **ready to run**.
   * `task == 1`: compute the energy-momentum spectrum
   * `task == 2`: compute wave function overlap
* `Haagerup_ch.py` contains the user-defined basis element object. The valid basis of Haagerup chain is generated iteratively, using a modified chain data structure.
* `decomp_ch.py` contains the function that allows for simultanesouly diagonalization.
